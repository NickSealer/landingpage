      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p id='motor' className='show-js'>The engine in the Enzo is longitudinally mounted, and the car has a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with a 44%/56% front/rear weight distribution. The powerplant is Ferrari's F140B naturally aspirated 65° V12 engine with DOHC 4 valves per cylinder, variable valve timing and Bosch Motronic ME7 fuel injection with a displacement of 5,998.80 cc (6.0 L; 366.1 cu in) generating a power output of 660 PS (485 kW; 651 hp) at 7,800 rpm and 657 N⋅m (485 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. The redline is 8,200 rpm.</p>
      <p id='brakes' className='hide-js'>The Enzo has an automated manual transmission (known as the F1 gearbox) using paddle-shifters to control an automatically actuated electrohydraulic clutch and shifting mechanism, with LED lights on the steering wheel telling the driver when to change gears. The gearbox has a shift time of 150 milliseconds and was built by Graziano Trasmissioni. The transmission was a first-generation "clutchless" design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints about its abrupt shifting.
        The Enzo has four-wheel independent suspension with push-rod-actuated shock absorbers, which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with anti-roll bars at the front and rear.
        The Ferrari Enzo used carbon-ceramic brake discs, a first for a Ferrari road car.
        The Enzo uses 19-inch (482.6 mm) wheels and has 15-inch (381.0 mm) Brembo disc brakes. The wheels are held by a single lug nut and fitted with Bridgestone Potenza Scuderia RE050A tyres.</p>
      <p id='performance' className='hide-js'>One-way downhill with 1-foot rollout the Enzo can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 3.14 seconds and can reach 161 km/h (100 mph) in 6.6 seconds. The ¼-mile (~400 m) time is about 11 seconds, on skidpad it has reached 1.05g, and the top speed has been recorded to be as high as 355 km/h (221 mph). It is rated at 34 litres per 100 kilometres (6.9 mpg‑US) in the city, 20 L/100 km (12 mpg‑US) on the highway and 29 L/100 km (8.1 mpg‑US) combined.
        Evo tested the Enzo on the famed Nordschleife Circuit and ran a 7:25.21 lap time. The Enzo in the test had a broken electronic damper. They also tested it at Bedford Autodrome West circuit, where it recorded a 1:21.3 lap time, which is 1.1 seconds slower than the Porsche Carrera GT, but faster than the Litchfield Type-25.</p>
